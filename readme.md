This is a e-commerce web app, with django as backend and react on front. This is a somewhat repica of www.chaldal.com which is a great site to order everyday stuff. This is quite a full stack project for my current caliber. Accounts can be created by users, orders and ordered products are added to their databases and relations established with foreign keys. If 10 orders are done from an account, it will get 10% discount on next orders. Django restapi and their authentication system is used.
Product adding can be done from django admin dashboard, although as the server is hosted on heroku, new images can't be added as heroku don't provide static file storage. So I just added 2/3 products per category, as this is just a demonstration.
